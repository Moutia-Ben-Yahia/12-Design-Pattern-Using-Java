# 12 Famous Design Patterns using Java ðŸ˜Ž :
### 1. Abstract Factory : 
Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It helps in producing a set of objects that follow a common theme.
### 2. Bridge : 
Decouples an abstraction from its implementation, allowing the two to vary independently. It separates the object's interface from its actual implementation to improve flexibility and extensibility.
### 3. Builder : 
Simplifies complex object construction by separating the creation process from its representation. It builds an object step by step and allows for different representations of the same construction process.
### 4. Composite : 
Composes objects into tree-like structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
### 5. Decorator : 
Dynamically adds or alters the behavior of an object by wrapping it in a new class, without modifying the original class. Useful for adding functionality incrementally.
### 6. Factory : 
Defines an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. It abstracts the process of instantiating objects from their concrete types.
### 7. Iterator : 
Provides a way to sequentially access the elements of a collection without exposing its underlying representation. It decouples the traversal from the actual collection.
### 8. Observer : 
Defines a one-to-many dependency where multiple objects (observers) listen for changes in another object (subject). When the subject changes state, all registered observers are notified.
### 9. Prototype : 
Creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype. It avoids the cost of creating new instances from scratch and supports cloning complex objects.
### 10. Proxy : 
Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. Useful for lazy initialization, access control, or logging.
### 11. Strategy : 
Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It allows the algorithm to vary independently from the clients that use it.
### 12. Visitor : 
Separates an algorithm from the object structure it operates on, allowing you to add new operations to a structure without modifying its classes. It uses double dispatch to apply operations on elements.
